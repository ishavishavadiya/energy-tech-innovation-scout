    "title": "Emergence and transition of incompressible phases in decorated Landau levels",
    "abstract": "We show a single Landau level (LL) dressed with periodic electrostatic potentials can realize a plethora of interacting topological phases where the Hall conductivity generally does not equal to the LL filling factor. Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states\" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q>1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential. The dLL and the associated dispersive bands can serve as minimal theoretical models for correlated physics in lattice or moire systems; they are also highly tunable experimental platforms for realizing rich phase diagrams of exotic 2D quantum fluids.",

    "title": "Distributed Perceptron under Bounded Staleness, Partial Participation, and Noisy Communication",
    "abstract": "We study a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron trained via iterative parameter mixing (IPM-style averaging): clients run local perceptron updates and a server forms a global model by aggregating the updates that arrive in each communication round. The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.",

    "title": "Late-time acceleration without a vacuum term in ${f(R,L_m)}$ gravity: scaling deSitter dynamics and parameter constraints",
    "abstract": "We investigate late-time cosmic acceleration in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity driven by nonlinear matter contributions, focusing on the class $f(R,L_m)=R/2+c_1 L_m+c_n L_m^{n}+c_0$ with the explicit choice $L_m=\u03c1_m$ and an uncoupled radiation sector. We analyze two realizations: (i) Case A: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+\u03b2\u03c1_m^{n}+\u03b3$, where $\u03b3$ acts as a vacuum term, and (ii) Case B: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+\u03b2\u03c1_m+\u03b3\u03c1_m^{n}$, where the nonlinear sector can mimic dark energy without an explicit cosmological constant. For each case, we construct a bounded autonomous system, classify all critical points and their stability, and compute cosmographic diagnostics. The phase-space analysis shows that Case A reproduces the standard radiation$\\to$matter$\\to$de~Sitter sequence only for $n\\gtrsim 4/5$, with acceleration essentially enforced by the vacuum term. In contrast, Case~B admits a qualitatively distinct and phenomenologically appealing branch: for $0<n<1/2$ the system possesses a physical \\emph{scaling} de~Sitter future attractor inside the bounded simplex, yielding radiation$\\to$matter$\\to$acceleration with $q=-1$ and $\u03c9_{\\rm eff}=-1$ and without introducing $c_0$. We confront both models with background data (CC, Union3, DESI BAO, plus a BBN prior on $\u03a9_b h^2$) using nested sampling and perform model comparison via Bayesian evidence and AIC/BIC. The full data combination constrains $n=1.08\\pm0.05$ in Case A and $n=0.05\\pm0.10$ in Case B (68\\% CL), the latter lying within the accelerating window while remaining statistically consistent with $\u039b$CDM kinematics at the background level. We also record minimal consistency conditions for stability (tensor no-ghost and luminal propagation) and motivate a dedicated perturbation-level analysis as the next step to test growth and lensing observables.",

    "title": "Increasing the opening speed of the plasma opening switch on an direct action accelerator with an inductive energy storage device",
    "abstract": "To increase the voltage multiplication factor in a small-sized direct-acting electron accelerator DIN-2K with an inductive energy storage and a plasma opening switch, it is necessary to ensure an increase in the rate of change of the current and its amplitude during the POS opening for the purpose of obtaining an explosive electron emission with the formation of an electron beam and a virtual cathode. However, the opening process depends on many electrical parameters of the plant, and it re-quires determining their joint and individual effect on its dynamics. The purpose of this research is to study and determine the effects of electrical parameters, including those of the discharge voltages of the entire electrical circuit of the accelerator on the dynamics of the plasma opening switch, in particular opening speed, current amplitudes, and opening time, as well as to give recommendations on optimizing the operation of accelerators of this type and highlight possible ways to increase the voltage multiplication factor. Methodology. A method for determining the induced voltage according to experimental current oscillograms has been proposed. The methodology was verified by the coincidence of its data with the results of measurements by a capacitive voltage divider with the data spread of less than 20%. Scientific novelty. The rates of change in the current at the plasma switch opening stage were determined depending on the main electrical parameters of the DIN-2K accelerator. The diagnostics of the voltage induced during the POS opening were provided using no capacitive voltage divider in the internal volume of the accelerator, which enabled the removal of some diagnostic tools from the working volume of the chamber. Practical significance.",

    "title": "Efficiency, Curvature, and Complexity of Quantum Evolutions for Qubits in Nonstationary Magnetic Fields",
    "abstract": "In optimal quantum-mechanical evolutions, motion can take place along paths of minimal length within an optimal time frame. Alternatively, optimal evolutions may occur along established paths without any waste of energy resources and achieving 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios often lead to less-than-ideal evolutions that demonstrate suboptimal efficiency, nonzero curvature, and a high level of complexity. In this paper, we provide an exact analytical expression for the curvature of a quantum evolution pertaining to a two-level quantum system subjected to various time-dependent magnetic fields. Specifically, we examine the dynamics produced by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. To enhance our understanding of the physical implications of the curvature coefficient, we analyze the curvature behavior in relation to geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the complexity of the quantum evolution (as described by the ratio of the difference between accessible and accessed Bloch-sphere volumes for the evolution from initial to final state to the accessible volume for the given quantum evolution). Our findings indicate that, generally, efficient quantum evolutions exhibit lower complexity compared to inefficient ones. However, we also note that complexity transcends mere length. In fact, longer paths that are sufficiently curved can demonstrate a complexity that is less than that of shorter paths with a lower curvature coefficient.",
